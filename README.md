Umidasu is a data center telemetry simulator project to generate streaming data for my personal experimentation.\
The intent is to stream simulated data points such as:\
✅Power Utilization\
✅Server Inlet Temperature\
✅Humidity\
✅Hot & Cold aisle pressure and temperature\
✅Weather conditions (Likely with historical ASHRAE data)\

These metrics will be influenced by rack position within an imagined facility both in the aisle and within a room. The data points I generate will allow me to get creative with for machine learning, streaming (Kafka), storage, visualization, and statistical analysis.
